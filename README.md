 <p>Note: Descriptions are based on my perspective.</p>
  <p><strong>Attack on Titan: </strong>A dark, fictional, action and apocalyptic anime series <br/>A story of the world misery through humans' hunger for power and path of exploitation, creating a divide in the world as two groups, Marley-Eldia where Eldians are the ones who are restricted and suppressed. The story revolves around hatred, exploitation, human's misery and insecurities for living or thriving. Within the story, a boy named Eren whose emotions and urges are shown to be changing unpredictably with the situations and time, is the one who changes the course of humanity's fate with the urge to save his kind, destroy the others, along with a core urge for freedom, but with a questionable action at the end. A brilliant masterpiece!😈</p>

 <p><strong>Death Note: </strong>Mystery, psychological and supernatural thriller anime <br/>
Death Note follows Light Yagami, a genius student who discovers a notebook that lets him kill anyone by writing their name. Believing he can get the world rid of evil and crimes, he becomes the infamous "Kira". His actions draw the attention of L, a brilliant but eccentric detective determined to stop him. This sparks a tense battle of wits, deception, and strategy. As Light's power grows, new allies and enemies emerge, escalating the conflict. The story explores justice, morality, and the consequences of absolute power in a suspenseful psychological thriller.</p>

<p><strong>Demon Slayer - S1, Mugen Train, S3, S4: </strong>Adventure and dark fantasy <br/>
 The story of the fate of humanity distorted currently by the antagonist called Muzan who wants to turn all of the humankinds into demons.

  <summary>Series/Movies - Done</summary>
 <p>Note: Descriptions are based on my perspective.</p>
  <p><strong>Squid Games S1, S2: </strong>A survival, thriller series. <br/>It showcases how the human psychology is sensitive to pain, suffering, misery, and societal supression and exploitation and therefore, flexible and easily bendable over allurement, rewards and punishment, driven by greed for weaker and manipulative intents for stronger.</p>

  <p><strong>The Pursuit of Happyness: </strong>A biographical drama. <br/>The story of an American businessman, Chris Gardner during his peak phase of struggle. Depicts the story from the perspective of Chris, who keeps following his dream, with the supression of internal emotions, obligations and family conditions. Within the story, I loved how he survived on the sales of medical scanner with an obvious family condition, until he achieves what he wants to, without showing off any of his emotions to those associated with work and still remaining static on his nature as a good and straight-forward man.😄 <br/>
Chris Gardner: "You got a dream... You gotta protect it".😇
